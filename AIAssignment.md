### Part 2

I used AI here to make some higher-level design decisions and to get an idea of how to start certain components, such as animations, which I do not have as much experience with. Answers through traditional search engines were not as adequate since it did not have the context behind the assignment, and thus the higher-level design decision choices would differ across applications. AI also helped give structure to some of my css/styling.

### Part 3

I think the AI's responses were actually pretty robust. As for the higher-level design decision around whether to choose routing or simple rendering based on a boolean, I liked how the AI suggested the rendering. After fully implementing the design rather than going back and rewriting everything, I feel that it's choice was correct, and the reasoning made sense too, since routing would have been overkill for this assignment. For this response, I don't think it hallucinated any details. I accepted its general suggestion and integrated it into my work, but for this response there was no direct code generation I used in my code.

### Part 4

I was not super familiar with how to implement spinners in Typescript/CSS for loading states. I did not know that CSS would automatically transition between the two states in the animation (0% and 100% for rotating), which was surprisingly easier than I expected.
